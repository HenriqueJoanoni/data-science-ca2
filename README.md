# NBA Player Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict NBA player performance metrics, with a particular focus on forecasting points per game (
PPG) in future seasons using historical career statistics and performance trends. The project follows a data science
workflow, progressing through business understanding, data mining, cleaning, exploration, feature engineering,
predictive modelling, and presentation of findings.

## Objective

To develop a robust predictive model for estimating NBA players' PPG, identifying key performance indicators, and
providing actionable insights for teams, coaches, and analysts.

## Business Context

Accurate player performance prediction is crucial for:

- Contract negotiations and salary cap management
- Draft strategy and talent acquisition
- Game strategy and rotation decisions
- Injury prevention and load management
- Applications in sports betting, fantasy sports, and sports media

## Project Steps

1. **Business Understanding**: Problem definition, response variable specification, and context.
2. **Data Mining**: Data collection via [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api).
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
4. **Data Exploration**: Statistical analysis and data visualisation.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Creation and selection of relevant variables.
6. **Predictive Modelling**: Building and validating regression models.
7. **Presentation of Findings**: Generating insights and recommendations.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nba-player-performance
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
        python3 -m venv nba_env
        source nba_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the notebook**:
   ```sh
        jupyter notebook nba_data_mining.ipynb
   ```
